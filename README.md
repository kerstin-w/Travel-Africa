## <a name="desgin">Design</a>

### <a name="colour-palette">Colour Palette</a>

To create a colour palette, I used [_Mycolor.space_](https://mycolor.space/). The color palette consists of deep blues meant to evoke the sea and sky, warm yellows and oranges meant to evoke the sun, and a skin tone-like color that can be associated with the various cultures of Africa. The palette also includes a mellow white that reflects the natural and unspoiled beauty of African landscapes and wildlife,

### <a name="fonts">Fonts</a>
[_Sourced via Google Fonts._](https://fonts.google.com/)

**Heading:** 
- For Headings, "Waiting for the Sunrise" font was selected, which has a handwritten and adventurous feel and complements the theme of travel and exploration.

**Body:** 
- “Roboto”, is a clean and modern font which is easy to read, making it a good choice for body text and enhancing readability for the readers. 

### <a name="images">Images</a> 

[*Sourced via Pexels.*](https://www.pexels.com/)

Images are an important aspect of the Travel Blog, as they help to enhance the users's experience and provide a visual representation of the destinations and experiences being discussed. They make the content more engaging and visually appealing. All images I used as blog creater, where compressed them with [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/). The downside is, that I cannot control the size of pictures uploaded by the user and its effect on the loading time. 

* The home page includes a carousel in the Hero banner, which shows three images of Africa to draw the user's immediate attention to Africa.

* Users can upload a picture of the destination in their blog post, which will be featured on the blog post page, as well as on the post list page. 

* Users can upload a picture of themselves in their profile to make it a more personalized experience.

## <a name="agile-methodology">Agile methodology</a>

All functionality and development of this project were managed using GitHub which Projects can be found
[here](https://github.com/users/kerstin-w/projects/6)

### <a name="moscow-method-and-story-points">MoSCoW method and story points</a>

To implement agile methodology, the Kanban board and Issues feature on GitHub Projects were utilized. 
6 Epics were created which were then further developed into User Stories. User stories were first created and then prioritized using the MoSCoW method. The points were assigned to each story based on their complexity, amount of work, and repetition using a modified Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, and so on).Each User Story was assigned a classification of `Must Have`, `Should Have`, `Could Have` or `Won't Have`.  In practice some of the User Stories were completed quicker than anticipated and other User Stories took a longer.
The details are as following:
