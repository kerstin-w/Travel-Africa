### <a name="colour-palette">Colour Palette</a>

To create a colour palette, I used [_Mycolor.space_](https://mycolor.space/). The color palette consists of deep blues meant to evoke the sea and sky, warm yellows and oranges meant to evoke the sun, and a skin tone-like color that can be associated with the various cultures of Africa. The palette also includes a mellow white that reflects the natural and unspoiled beauty of African landscapes and wildlife,

### <a name="fonts">Fonts</a>

**Heading:** 
- For Headings, "Waiting for the Sunrise" font was selected, which has a handwritten and adventurous feel and complements the theme of travel and exploration.

**Body:** 
- “Roboto”, is a clean and modern font which is easy to read, making it a good choice for body text and enhancing readability for the readers.
