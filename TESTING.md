## <a name="validator-testing">Validator Testing</a>

### <a name="html">HTML</a>
All **HTML** code was validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) regularly during the development process. **The HTML Source Code** was regularly viewed for each page using **Google Chrome** and passed through the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). Various minor errors were encountered and corrected during the final **HTML** validation check. 
A few errors occurred with summernote during the validation process. The `summernot-div` had attributes for `cols` and `rows` which resulted in an error during validation. I fixed that by copying the `widget_iframe.html` into my templates and styling the width with my custom CSS. Remaining issues with Summernote are the `<textarea>` element, which is set to `hidden=true` and CSS Parse Erros for blog posts that users created using Summernote. After consulting with Tutor Support about it, they advised me not to try and fix it since I did not develope the package myself and this could result in the package not functioning correctly. Besides Summernote, all HTML code now passes validation with no errors or warnings.
